# P5.js-Viewer
This is for project "P5.js Viewer" App of my class Mobile App Development Lab.

My Swift Journey:
Week01-Week02: Hacking with SwiftUI day01-14;
Week03: Had the idea of mobile app of p5.js;
Week04: Found out that should apply WKWebView;
Week05: Applied WKWebView and had examples in the app;
Week06: Save Image (by having a buffer);
Week07: Trying to save animations (Failed);
Week08: Updating the View
Week09: Search Artist by p5.js API, making them a JSON
Week10: Save to my Collections;

Tasks Ahead:
1. Save Animation: Using Socket to constantly export data
2. [Problem]: Causing a lot of heat in opening the sketch(no matter where)
3. Applying the firebase

[Week08]: Trying to use CCapture for Sketches, but auto download is prohibited in WKWebView. Trying to figure it out as URL Request and am currently looking into the source codes.


[Week09]: Scrolling View with Firebase is here!




[Week10]: **[Final Proposal]**:
This is the p5.js mobile viewer that shows, presents and shares sketches from p5.js.

Using the offical API from p5.js web editor, every user can access to sketches that belong to a specific artist, with the name of the author.

For p5.js artists, it's a place for them to publish their works to more people, as well as displaying the sketches on mobile devices.

For generative art fans, it's a place they can keep track of artists and also get fresh new artworks in the world.

This is an decentralized place. Every user here are equivalent. Enjoy!

**[FeedBack]**:
1. Think about what makes it different from using website. (Zhiyang)
2. Example sketches optimized for phones.
