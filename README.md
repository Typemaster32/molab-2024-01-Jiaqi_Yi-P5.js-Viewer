# P5.js-Viewer
This is for project "P5.js Viewer" App of my class Mobile App Development Lab.

My Swift Journey:
Week01-Week02: Hacking with SwiftUI day01-14;
Week03: Had the idea of mobile app of p5.js;
Week04: Found out that should apply WKWebView;
Week05: Applied WKWebView and had examples in the app;
Week06: Save Image (by having a buffer);
Week07: Trying to save animations (Failed);
Week08: Updating the View
Week09: Search Artist by p5.js API, making them a JSON
Week10: Save to my Collections;

Tasks Ahead:
1. Save Animation: Using Socket to constantly export data
2. [Problem]: Causing a lot of heat in opening the sketch(no matter where)
3. Applying the firebase
